 - Find F5 libraries where the rarefaction curves cross (if possible in all
   replicates).  Use them as examples to show that the scale of subsampling
   is always arbitrary.

 - Summarise which metrics vary with depth and which are aproximately
   invariant.  For instance, promoter rate and other annotations are
   invariant, but gene discovery varies.

 - Give a few thought examples, for example 1 billion identical reads
   plus one unique read: total number of different reads = 2, but it
   is very unlikely to find this without sequencing dozens of millions.
