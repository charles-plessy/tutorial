Possible points to mention:

 - Dendrograms in R: heatmap(), hclust(), ...

 - Notion of distance; Pearson correlation is not a distance.

 - Robustness of distance regarding differences of sequencing depth.

 - Vertical scale in dendrograms: what it means.

 - How to use the dist() function.  When to use t() on the input.

 - Cluster the data direclty, do not cluster a correlation matrix by accident.

 - Bootstrap values with pvclust(); parallel calculation.
