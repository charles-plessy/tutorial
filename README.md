Tutorials for analysing CAGE and Deep-RACE data.
================================================

Various tutorials on how to analyse
[CAGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_analysis_gene_expression) data.

 * [[CAGE_differential_analysis2]]

These tutorials are designed to be executed on a Linux system's command line
interface (also called _Terminal_or _shell_).  The programs used are assumed to
be installed in advance.  On the [Debian](http://www.debian.org) operating
system, many of them (BWA, SAMtools, BEDTools, ...) are available pre-packaged
and will be installed (altogether with many other programs) by the command
`apt-get install med-bio`.
